CODE AUDIT

The only contract that needs to be audited is: Bearcoin.

DevBearcoin and TestBearcoin are just for development/testing.

Originally during development/testing, all three contracts inherited from the abstract BearcoinBase, but for production use/audit/final testing, the inheritance was removed, visibility was locked down (internal->private), and each version was slightly modified as necessary.
