CODE AUDIT

The only contract that needs to be audited is: Bearcoin.

The other two contracts are just for development/testing.

Originally during development/testing, all three versions inherited from BearcoinBase,
but for production use/audit/final testing, the inheritance was removed, visibility was locked down (internal->private),
and then each version was slightly modified as necessary.
